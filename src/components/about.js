          On a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material
          drift down to earth surface. Every 10,000 years, it's expected that an
          asteroid larder than a100 meters would be expected to reach Earth's
          surface and cause local disasters. Scary right? Well rest assured,
          we'll be more than ready and will knowfar in advanced if any
          catastrophic event like that would ever happen

          Thanks to the brilliant researchers at{" "}
          <strong>The Center for Near Earth Object Studies</strong> information
          about Near Earth Objects(NEOs) has been readily available to us. They
          define Near Earth Objects as "comets and asteroids that have been
          nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets in to orbits
          that allow them to enter the Earths neigborhood."

          Their organization is dedicated to dilligently searching and studying
          in order to predict potential NEO collisions with our precisous Earth.
          Jokes aside, they've got some really interesting knowledge.{" "}
          <strong>The best part about it is, they've shared it will us!</strong>
